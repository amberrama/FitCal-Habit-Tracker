# FitCal-Habit-Tracker
This project is a habit tracker focused on fitness and meal planning. The main screen will have a monthly calendar view where users can click on days to log their workouts, meals, or other habits. Color-coding and icons will help show progress at a glance. There's also space for adding daily notes or setting goals for the week/month.
